typescript-nodejs-atom
======================

This is simply a skeleton project - you can copy it to bootstrap a NodeJS TypeScript project.

I've found that the documentation for tsconfig.json, tslint.json, how to build TypeScript with gulp, how to integrate
with Atom, and how to test, is spread over multiple sources. So this project aims to bring everything together in one
place.

NB mocha test are currently failing with:

```
TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'ui'
```

...need to work out why.
